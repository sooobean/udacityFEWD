                <p style="text-align: left;"> 
                    I started the day a little 
                    later at 8am, then got ready to go to the gym with some friends. We 
                    carpooled about 30 min away and took our first reformer pilates class! 
                    It was SO challenging but really fun, and I'm glad we took the class! 
                    Afterwards, we tried an authentic Italian cafe where we shared a panini 
                    filled with pesto, burrata, and a meat. The bread was foccacia and 
                    was quite honestly amazing. We each got a coffee and shared an 
                    almond croissant at the end as well. After hanging out with them, 
                    I took a dip in the pool before washing up and sitting down to 
                    study. I also had a psychiatry follow up and therapy session today! 
                    For dinner, my mom made dak kalguksu, a korean dish that I 
                    love. I ended up falling asleep afterwards because I ate too much 
                    haha. But! I got up and finished some work off, so today was a 
                    great day. (:
